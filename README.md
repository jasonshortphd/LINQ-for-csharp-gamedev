# LINQ for C# GameDev

This is a sample repository for a course I am working on about LINQ for game developers.

I was at a weekend gamejam helping people and noticed that a lot of the Unity developers were writing a LOT of code that could have been greatly reduced using LINQ.  I helped them refactor there code and ended up spending about 30 minutes explaining how LINQ works.  Since I did that for them I thought I would document it more formally and make a simple class out of it.

## Folders:

linqpad\   This will be .linq files that can be opened in LINQPAD.  Each of these should be a stand alone file that you can load and run in Linqpad.  Nothing too complex, but meant to demo single concepts, from a gamedev perspective.  



## Information:

http://linqpad.net is where to get linqpad (there is a freee and paid version)
